1) Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

Amazon documentation:
   In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically
   switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ. The time
   it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the
   time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds. However,
   large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time.

Based on the documentation RDS failover takes about 120 seconds (typically), our minimum RTO
for this incident must be 2 minutes.

2) Minimum RTO for a single region outage

To start to work in another region after a region outage we need to promote
the read replica DB. This take a few minutes, hence the RTO could be 5 minutes.


3) Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

According to documentation if we activate "automatic backup" we can choose a
recovery point within the last 5 minutes of the "retention period".
Therefore, our minimum RPO to this incident is 5 minutes.


4) Minimum RPO for a single region outage

To estimate this time is necessary using the "ReplicaLag" metric. This metrics
moves in the range of milliseconds, so our minimum RPO to this incident could be
1 second.
